	Got a special skein of sock yarn but you're not sure you'll have enough yardage?' Does knitting on
	double points make you feel like you're losing a fight with a hedgehog?' Does picking up gusset stitches
	make your eyes cross? Have you been vanquished by the deadly Second Sock Syndrome?' This class
	will allow you to deal with these problems and more, by learning how to knit 2 toe-up socks side by side
	on one long circular!' Techniques will include learning the Magic Loop method, a really nifty cast-on,
	afterthought heels and working both your socks at the same time, using a basic generic sock pattern
	that will allow you to use any yarn weight to make socks that are uniquely your own.' Students should
	have completed at least one sock (or sock class) prior to taking this, and have basic knitting skills.

<!-- Cheryl Brunette WORKSHOP -->
<div class="class_special">
	<div>
		<p class="class_heading">CHERYL BRUNETTE&mdash;awesome author and teacher&mdash;is coming to ThreadBear
			July 10th &amp; 11th!</p>

		<p>While you may not recognize her name immediately (tho Rob is a major fan and has been for at
			least a decade&mldr; more on this shortly), you're gonna LOVE her, her classes, and her AMAZING
			book. This book is called <em>Sweater 101</em>, and it's the ultimate reference guide for
			knitters of ALL skill levels, covering fit, structure, and the design process, all intended to guide
			you in creating perfect projects every time. Rob's owned a copy for over 10 years, having
			purchased one at Yarn For Ewe way back when, during his first time living in Lansing. And
			guess what? She's a MICHIGANDER (now living in Washington, but&mldr; close enough!).</p>

		<p>We're fortunate to have Cheryl here for two days in mid-July, conducting three different workshops:</p>
	</div>

	<div class=class_item>How to Make Sweaters that Fit You and Your Loved Ones</span> <span
			class="class_craft">in&nbsp;KNIT</span></div>
	<div class=class_description>
		<p>Knitting a sweater is a commitment. You put a lot of time and money into it and you want to be
			proud of the results. In this small, hands-on class we will go through all the steps to create
			individualized patterns for each student. Do something once and you'll vaguely remember parts of
			the process. Do something 8 to 12 times and you will own the process. It becomes part of your skill
			set. After this class you'll have the confidence to choose your yarn, worked at your gauge in your
			style and create sweaters that fit you and your loved one whether you're using a commercial pattern
			or designing your own.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>learn make a proper gauge swatch and measure it with an accuracy worthy of NASA</li>
			<li>know the three sources of measurements for sizing a sweater</li>
			<li>create a simple-to-follow &quot;Picture Pattern&quot; for each sweater you make</li>
			<li>easily chart a set-in sleeve cap without a single hypotenuse squared</li>
			<li>have the tools you need to organize your knitting life</li>
			<li>use two simple math skills to save time on every sweater you knit</li>
			<li>adapt a pattern to your yarn, gauge and body size</li>
			<li>change necklines and collars on any sweater</li>
			<li>fall in love with any yarn and buy it, confident that you can make your own pattern for it</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Cost for this awesome workshop is just $115 and includes a copy of <em>Sweater 101</em> ($32.95
			retail), making the class really just $82! (and includes a FREE seat in the second class on Saturday&mldr;
			below!)
		</p>

	<div class=class_item>Knitting, S.E.X.*, Chocolate and A Couple of Math Skills <span
			class="class_craft">in&nbsp;KNIT</span></div>
	<div class=class_description>
		<p>Does it get any better than this? NO!!! You get to talk about all of your favorite things (plus math!)
			in this great session with Cheryl. In this class you'll learn two very handy knitting math skills:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>how to use your calculator memory, and</li>
			<li>the &quot;More-Or-Less-Right-Formula&quot; which Meg Swansen (Elizabeth Zimmermann's
				daughter) says &quot;is worth the price of the book [<em>Sweater 101</em>] unto itself.&quot;
				You really want to know this skill.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Recently, Ann Budd taught at a weekend knitting camp and wrote in her blog, &quot;From the
			feedback I got, the best trick I showed the campers was the shaping formula from Cheryl Brunette's
			book <em>Sweater 101</em>&mldr;&quot; The chocolate is just for fun, and will be a variety of things,
			from Hershey's Kisses to home-made yummies from Rob's kitchen and more!
		</p>

		<p>Oh, and the SEX part&mldr; that's *Stash Enhancement Expedition</p>

		<p>Cost for this class is just $20 and includes CHOCOLATE!</p>

	Never fear, and no, you won't need Underdog. Often feared for their peculiar appearance with multiple
	needles poking out at odd angles, these smaller projects are remarkably simple as well as infinitely
	portable. Waiting in line, at a football game, even during lectures and movies, these quick-to-knit
	and easily stowed projects are often knitters' candy&mdash;simple, quick, and on to the next project.
	This class focuses on the basics using traditional construction and tools*, but with these simple
	guidelines, you can move easily into more detailed patterns with confidence.</div>

	Using light-worsted/dk-weight yarn and the new pattern from Cottage Creations, you'll learn two-color
	knitting techniques (stranded knitting, a.k.a. fair isle knitting) to create beautiful hats for the entire
	family (sizes range from toddlers through large adults). This small-sized, small-investment project
	is just the ticket for those looking to explore the world of color knitting without the pressure (and
	expense) of an entire sweater! This is a great way to learn two-handed fair isle techniques on a small
	project that's quick to finish and a great way to learn continental knitting, too (carrying yarn in your

	This felted bag is knitted using the entrelac method, a fun technique
	that resembles a basketweave pattern. The bag's deep, round shape is great for shopping at open-air
	summer markets as well as serving very well as a knitting/project bag (deep body with double straps).
	Not only will you learn how to knit entrelac, you'll learn how to knit backwards (trust me, it's fun and
	very useful). Best of all, it's a great way to try entrelac, as any minor boo-boos will be felted away in
	the washing machine.</div>

	Join Marcia for an excursion to the western Chicago suburbs to participate in one of the largest knitting
	and crochet expos in North America, and you don't even have to drive in I-294 traffic around the city
	(that alone is worth the price of the trip!). On Saturday, August 21st, the bus leaves the ThreadBear
	parking lot at 7:30am and heads for Chicagoland, where you'll arrive in time for taking an afternoon
	class or just peruse the market for several hours, taking in the textures and colors and celebrities
	wandering the aisles. There's tons of unique vendors, plenty of demos to observe, lots of fun (on the
	bus each way and while you're there), and more&mdash;all for the low, low price of $75 (which includes
	your admission to the market, motor coach ride complete with clean bathroom, door prizes, and other
	surprises). You'll be back in the Lansing area by 11pm according to your tour guide, Marcia, so be sure
	to sign up right away for the best seating&mdash;and if there's enough of you going, we might even
	get a second bus! There are tentative stops planned in Charlotte and Kalamazoo (or the nearby area)
	if you're interested in getting together a group and board the bus a little closer to home.<br /><br />
