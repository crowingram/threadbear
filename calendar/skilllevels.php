<tr><td class="main">Beginner</td><td class="main">Either you've never tried this before, or you're just learning.  You might know a knit from a purl, but if someone asked you to make one, you might need to excuse yourself.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="main">Novice</td><td class="main">You know how to make knit and purl stitches, and you're fabric&mdash;if not even to begin with&mdash;looks fine after a mild blocking.  You may have made a few scarves, and if someone told you to work a decrease, you <em>might</em> know enough to ask which one.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="main">Intermediate</td><td class="main">You have several increases and decreases in your bag of tricks, but you might need to refer to a reference to make sure you're using the right one for the task.  You might have tried cables (which means, that you realize, now, how easy they are).  If you had to, you could probably figure out a solution to a pattern glitch, but you probably tend to ask for confirmation from a more advanced knitter before continuing.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="main">Advanced</td><td class="main">You can carry on a conversation with someone about the merits of cast-ons, various decreases, and methods of weaving in ends.  You're probably one of those people who other people bring their knitting issues to.  You may not know it all, but you have a good idea of where to look for a solution.</td></tr>
