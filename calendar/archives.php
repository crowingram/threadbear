		<div class="class_item">Continental Knitting</div>
			<div class="class_skill">Skill Level:  Novice to Advanced.</div>
			<div class="class_description">Knitting Continental style involves holding the yarn in your left hand and "picking" it, as opposed to holding the yarn in your right hand and "throwing" it (English style).  When you hold the yarn in your right hand, you have to let go of your knitting in order to "throw" the yarn around the needle when making a stitch.  When you hold the yarn in your left hand, you never have to let go of your needles.  Both hands are used more equally, so the strain on your right shoulder and wrist are lessened considerably. Best of all, stitch patterns involving switching between knit and purl stitches can be done quickly and easily.  If you're interested in knitting more comfortably or with greater speed, this class is for you!</div>

You'll need size 8 or 9 straight needles (wood/bamboo preferred) and a small ball of worsted-weight, feltable yarn for starters. The first project is a wristband (it finishes quickly and is cool for girls and boys alike). Who knows what the following projects might be? Of course, Lynn has several possibilities up her sleeve if the kids come up short on their own ideas.</div>

For everyone working on these fun sock scrap blankets, bring your project in progress (or completed!) by that evening for some show-and-tell (and those interested in taking the class or signed up for the class on the 24th), you'll see what you'll be working on as well as have the chance to swap yarns with a variety of folks who are also working on the project (just think of the variety and FUN you'll have that night). No sign-ups are necessary&mdash;just show up and have fun, sometime around 6pm/dinner hour (time to be solidified in a couple weeks, after Meg finalizes her travel plans).</div>

	 	<div class=class_item style="color: #2F6C6D"><i>Interweave Crochet</i> Magazine<br>Fall Issue Launch Party</div>
			<div class=class_description>Come get your crochet on (or at least come learn more about this ancient fiber art)! Join the editor of <i>Interweave Crochet</i>, <b>Kim Werker</b>, and <b>Sandi Wiseheart</b>, editor of <i>Knitting Daily</i>, for a sneak peak at the fall issue and so much more, all here at ThreadBear. If you crochet, you will NOT want to miss this, and if you think you MIGHT be interested in crochet, you MUST be here for this FREE FUNCTION that's a very special event; if you don't want to crochet, this event will change your mind!</div>
			<div class=class_description>This two-part FREE FUNCTION kicks off at 3pm with Kim, who will lead you through a preview of the Fall 2008 issue of <i>Interweave Crochet</i> with a trunk show of garments, accessories, and more. Kim will take us on an in-depth walk-through of the projects as well as what goes on behind the scenes of a major fiber arts publication, from beginning to end. She'll also lead a question-and-answer session on the design selection process as well as entertain any questions you might have for her about being an editor of a magazine that's part of the Interweave family of publications. Budding designersÑhere's your chance to garner tips and advice!</div>
			<div class=class_description>We'll then take a little bit of a break and do a little meet-and-greet/ one-on-one socializing with Kim and Sandi, as well as take some time to admire the trunk show items as a preview of the next event, which starts around 5pm.</div>
			<div class=class_description>Sandi is famous for many things, but if you know her through <i>Knitting Daily</i>, you are definitely familiar with her gallery photo shoots, where various people in the home office of Interweave Press try on garments from <i>Interweave Knits</i> to show how they look on a wide range of body shapes and types. She is also famous for her wonderful mannequin, Bertha, who sometimes stands in for a human model from time to time. Well, we're planning to do a FIRST TIME EVER gallery using the garments from the fall issue of <i>Interweave Crochet</i> and YOU as the models. Here's the perfect chance to try on a wide range of items ACTUALLY FROM the magazine as well as help Sandi develop a gallery for Crochet. While you're trying on the garments, Sandi will work with you and discuss fit and shaping as well as options for customizing the garment to fit and flatter YOUR figureÑwhere to add ease, where to take in a little bit, etc. Better than having a personal shopper, you'll have the wisdom and experience of a PERSONAL FITTER right here, at ThreadBear!</div>
			<div class=class_description>Again, there's NO COST for the event, but we'd like to know if you're coming so we're able to adequately prepare for this amazing visit with two amazing women. Please contact the shop and leave your name and phone number (again... there's NO CHARGE involved) so we can plan seating, refreshments, and more. PLAN TO HAVE FUN... WE ARE!</div>
			<div class=class_meetings>Fall Issue Preview begins at 3:00pm on Saturday, Sept. 20.<br>There will be a meet-and-greet between the Preview and the Gallery.<br>The Gallery begins at 5:00pm.</div>

She who seeks the most whack hairstyle ever (her words, folks&mdash;not ours), stands on beaches, fords streams, and lies in the floor to be photographed with a mannequin leg, and designs some of the world's coolest socks is headed to the Bear, and you're cordially invited to join her.

			</div>
		
		<div class=class_item><span style="color: #2F6C6D;">Top Down Sock Design</span></div>
			<div class=class_skill>Skill Level:  Students must have knit at least one non-stockinette sock from the top down.  Chart reading abilities will be VERY useful but aren't necessary. </div>
			<div class=class_description>This workshop is geared towards intermediate to advanced sock knitters who are interested in a hands-on approach to designing their own socks.  Students can bring in stitch patterns or choose stitch patterns from books during class.  We will go over key calculations that need to be made for a standard top down sock using the students' chosen stitch patterns.  Handouts and worksheets will be provided, so students can easily calculate stitch counts.  By the end of this class, students should have a good start on their very own sock, and the necessary tools to complete the sock on their own.  Materials required:  Sock yarn and needles.</div>
			<div class=class_meetings>Choose from 10:00am to 1:00pm on EITHER Saturday, Sept. 27, OR Sunday, Sept. 28.</div>

			<div class=class_description>Who says toe-up socks have to use a short row heel?  Knitters with high insteps will be pleased to learn that it's just as easy to knit a toe-up sock with a gusset as it is to knit one top-down.  Students will learn how to provisionally cast on, a yarn over short row method, how to use short rows to create a toe-up sock with gusset and heel flap, and how to do the sewn bind off.  Materials required: Worsted weight yarn and size 7 dpns or two circular needles.</div>

				 <strong>Susanna Hansson</strong> is coming to ThreadBear the first weekend in May (the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th) to conduct a series of amazing workshops on topics never before taught in this area!  If you're not familiar with her, do check out her <a href="http://www.oneofsusannas.com" target="_blank">website</a>, but the short story is that she's a native of Sweden and a life-long knitter, well versed in traditional knitting techniques and designs.  She's taught at various XRX Stitches events around the country, conducted workshops at the Madrona Fiber Arts Retreat in Seattle, and is a much sought-after instructor.  Here's what we're offering to you:

		<div class="class_item"><span style="color: #2F6C6D;">Japanese Short Rows</span></div>
			<div class="class_skill">Skill Level:  Novice.</div>
			<div class="class_description">Have you ever wished there was a better way of shaping shoulders as you are struggling to match your &quot;stair-step&quot; bindoffs into a flat, good looking seam? There is! Shortrows are an elegant way of building shaping into your knitting and thus avoiding those stair-steps and it just may be the perfect way to shape both shoulders and collars. The Japanese shortrow is not entirely easy to learn, but it is by far the most polished of the shortrow methods available and once you master it, you will never again be faced with having to assemble those challenging stairstep shoulder bind-offs. Time permitting, we will discuss how to convert stair-step shoulder shaping instructions into shortrow shaping and I will also show you several examples of how collars can be shaped successfully using this technique.</div>

			<div class="class_skill">Skill Level:  Novice.</div>
			<div class="class_description">Are they accessories or jewelry? Hard to say. Either way, they knit up quickly, make great gifts and fun additions to a winter wardrobe. Or wear a sparkly pair with a plain black top and you will be dressed for a night on the town. On a cold day, keeping the pulse points warm will help you stay comfortable. Basic knitting skills are required, but there's nothing complicated about this type of bead knitting so cuffs are an ideal project for newer knitters as well as more experienced ones. Learn an easy way to calculate how many beads to string so you don't have to count each and every bead (a challenge if your pattern requires 300+ beads). Begin knitting with a provisional cast-on that will allow you to complete the wristlet with a three-needle bind-off instead of sewing it together.</div>

			<div class="class_skill">Skill Level:  Intermediate.</div>
			<div class="class_description">This workshop is based on Susanna's love for Bohus Stickning; the cottage industry turned couture business venture. The workshop includes a slide presentation and discussion of the Bohus Stickning industry; its origins, development, and eventual demise thirty years after it began. Participants will have an opportunity to see the many genuine, museum quality Bohus garments and accessories that Susanna has collected over the past 11 years. For the hands-on portion of the workshop, we will be using fine yarn and small needles to create wristlets in the Blue Shimmer pattern, so patience is required as well! Bohus patterns present particular challenges to knitters, even experienced ones, and part of the time will be spent discussing and comparing the Bohus knitting techniques to other, better-known, multi-color techniques.</div>

Easier and quicker than traditional Western knitting, this method creates a very even tension with less &quot;rowing out&quot; and less wrist strain. If this method is different than how you've been taught, give it a try and you may discover a new love of knitting blooming! If you're a first time knitter&mdash;enjoy! You can mistress this right away!</div>

			<div class="class_skill">Skill Level:  Novice.</div>
			<div class="class_description">Cables are a mainstay of knitting, but the technique for knitting them WITHOUT cable needles has eluded many expert knitters. Overcome your fear of cabling and at the same time learn a technique that is faster and easier than the standard technique which uses an extra needle to twist the yarn. Even if you're a beginning knitter, you can cable like an Irish Fisherman (or woman). Come prepared to knit!</div>

Don't be afraid, be bold and confident as you take up your needles&mdash;enjoy the full range of colored yarns that are all around you. In this class we will learn how to &quot;read&quot; a colorwork chart and learn the basics of changing colors in a row while knitting. We will also discuss the differences between Fair Isle and Intarsia, and compare different methods of carrying yarn across the back of the work. Come prepared to knit!</div>

Learn several different techniques for making vertical and horizontal buttonholes that are even and won't 'grow' as you wear your garment.

			<div class=class_description>In the class, we learn how to become our own crochet designer. Focusing on design techniques and tricks, we use a baby garment as an example (because they're smaller and quickly accomplished, even if you don't have a baby in mind for gifting). We talk about what yarns are good to use, what styles are easy to wear, and what stitches are best for kids. We will learn how to plan out a garment from stitch count to row count. Baby sweaters are a great stepping stone into garments since they do not require much shaping. By the end of the class, everyone will have their own design planned out for their unique baby sweater. This is a great class for any advanced beginner crocheter that is ready to take that next step into garment projects or for any aspiring designers that are looking for some tips.</div>

Fair Isle) techniques, Arnhild will get you familiar with the basics, including her own unique way of swatching. Then you'll spend all day Saturday soaking up the various skills needed to create your own family heirloom (these sweaters, with proper care, will last decades)! Based on your swatching and measurements, Saturday morning will see you starting your own project (choose from any of three different design options) and learning even more! You'll cover traditional edgings, inserting stitches for steeking, button bands and collars, setting sleeves, and more in this two-day seminar on these and more traditional Norwegian knitting techniques.</div>

			<div class=class_description>Using two colors of wool and a great pattern, we'll create a toasty warm hat sure to be useful in the coming months. You'll get to choose from two different options&mdash;a traditional stocking-cap shape or a Russian-style hat with a stranded band.</div>

				<hr style="color: #2F6C6D;">
				<strong>Terri Shea</strong>'s first book, <em>Selbuvotter: Biography of a Knitting Tradition</em> was published in 2007 and details the history and techniques of the famous folkloric patterned knitting of Selbu, Norway. Shown in the mittens and gloves of the region, Selbu knitting became a major cottage industry and provided income for thousands of families throughout the twentieth century. It's a fascinating look at the social roles knitting played in the region&mdash;clothing, rite of passage, money, power, and prestige. As an authority on this type of folk knitting, we're thrilled to have her back again for some in-depth classes. Read on!

			<div class=class_skill>Skill Level:  Intermediate to Advanced.<br>Students will need proficiency with double point needles, Magic Loop, or two circulars, and should be ready to knit stranded patterns in two colors.</div>
			<div class=class_description><em>Note from Terri:</em> Back to Lansing! We had such a nice time in February 2008, I can't wait to get back and see everyone's projects. Hopefully I won't be recovering from flu this time around. This is a great opportunity for those who took Mittens to pop in and learn the design parameters to create your own unique pattern. I will provide a chart template and you will use traditional motifs to fill in the spaces. Bring a pencil and prepare to be creative!</div>

			<div class=class_description><em>Note from Terri:</em> This is a great opportunity for those who took Mittens to spend the day learning the construction tips and tricks involved in knitting gloves. You'll need to get the homework assignment, however, because we're working in fingering weight yarn and I need you to finish the cuff before class begins (you won't want to miss the good stuff.). Gloves begin the same as mittens, but we'll add setting in the fingers, focusing on getting that beautiful divider line to match up between the fingers.</div>

			<div class=class_description><em>Note from Terri:</em> Hear the story behind Norway's most beloved traditional mitten style, the Selbuvotter, while you learn to make some for yourself. You will knit an original two-color design based on a year's research studying old mittens and gloves from Norway. Techniques to be covered include stranded knitting, a stranded cuff, shaping the thumb gusset, shaping the pointed fingertip, and working the thumb. In addition, students can examine thirty sample mittens and gloves from Terri's book, recreated from actual antiques and museum collections. Designing your own mittens and modifying mitten patterns to make gloves will also be discussed.</div>

				Knit a little purse, which is funky and fun by day, and interesting yet elegant by night, depending on your own mood! It can serve as a pouch that holds your "stuff" or as a sachet, filled with lavender or other smell-goods for your bedroom or closet. The perfect accessory for an evening out to the theater or concert, you'll increase across knit as well as purl sts; you'll learn how to create a Picot-hemmed tube, a twisted split, as well as bobbles worked on a split and you'll practice rag and a simple lacy stitch.</div>

				Come spend the day with Maggie learning the ins and outs of woring in squares! Your final project could be smaller and become a scarf, or keep knitting and turn it into either of two sizes for a dramatic wrap! For the truly daring, think about combining your squares to become a show-stopping linen skirt. Maggie will lead you through the process, as well as discussing other options like adding leather bows, fur strips, ridge stitches, ruffles, tubes, knot and tassels, and more!</div>

				<strong>CHERYL BRUNETTE&mdash;awesome author and teacher&mdash;is coming to ThreadBear July 10th &amp; 11th!!!</strong><br /><br />
                
                While you may not recognize her name immediately (tho Rob is a major fan and has been for at least a decade... more on this shortly), you're gonna LOVE her, her classes, and her AMAZING book.  This book is called <em>Sweater 101</em>, and it's the ultimate reference guide for knitters of ALL skill levels, covering fit, structure, and the design process, all intended to guide you in creating perfect projects every time.  Rob's owned a copy for over 10 years, having purchased one at Yarn For Ewe way back when, during his first time living in Lansing.  And guess what?  She's a MICHIGANDER (now living in Washington, but... close enough!).<br /><br />
                
                We're fortunate to have Cheryl here for two days in mid-July, conducting three different workshops:
			</div>
			
		<div class=class_item><span style="color: #2F6C6D;">Sweater Rescue</span> <span class="class_craft">in&nbsp;KNIT</span></div>
			<div class=class_skill>Skill Level:  Novice.</div>
			<div class=class_description>
            	Do you have an abandoned project . . . a partially, or even fully birthed sweater baby that you won't or can't wear or give away? Maybe it won't fit over your son's head or the bottom rib is way to loose or the sleeves are too long, or too short, or there's a big, gloppy knot front and center and you didn't find it until you were finished. Often these problem children can be fixed and finished with far less effort than you think. Not everything can be salvaged without ripping it out, but many "problems" can be fixed creatively. It's great to do this in a class setting because you learn lots of skills and workarounds (not just the one or two that will solve your problem) to common knitting "plagues," and it's a great confidence-builder.<br /><br />
                
                Seriously--dig under the bed and in the back of the closet and bring your orphans into a loving, supportive environment and let's see if we can make them whole and beautiful.  Bring to class at least one "problem sweater." That's one that you can't or won't wear or finish for any reason. Maybe your daughter got a sleeve caught on a nail and pulled a whole row tight and broke the yarn or maybe that peplum you thought was so cute in the picture is about four times too full on your hips. Bring as many as you have. This is a very fluid and creative class and we never know how many problems we can dissolve. Since the goal is to learn knitting workaround skills you can also bring projects that are not sweaters if you don't have any of those.  No matter what happens you'll feel better......and way more confident about your skills, too!<br /><br />
                
                Cost for this awesome day-long workshop is just $85 (and includes a FREE seat in the second class on Saturday.....read on!)</div>

			<div class=class_description>
            	Does it get any better than this?  NO!!!  You get to talk about all of your favorite things (plus math!) in this great session with Cheryl.  In this class you'll learn two very handy knitting math skills:<br /><br />
                
                1)  how to use your calculator memory, and<br /><br />
                
                2)  the "More-Or-Less-Right-Formula" which Meg Swansen (Elizabeth Zimmermann's daughter) says "ìs worth the price of the book [Sweater 101] unto itself." You really want to know this skill.<br /><br />
                
                Recently, Ann Budd taught at a weekend knitting camp and wrote in her blog, "From the feedback I got, the best trick I showed the campers was the shaping formula from Cheryl Brunette's book Sweater 101 . . ." The chocolate is just for fun, and will be a variety of things, from Hershey's Kisses to home-made yummies from Rob's kitchen and more!<br /><br />
                
                Oh, and the SEX part......that's *Stash Enhancement Expedition<br /><br />
