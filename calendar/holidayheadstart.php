					<div class=class_item>Anne-trelac Socks</div>
						<div class=class_skill>Skill Level:  Adventurous Novice with Some Sock Experience.</div>
						<div class=class_description>You've fallen in love with her pair that was on display at the shop, so why not make your own?  Sabrina will teach you the ins and outs of knitting entrelac fabric in the round (either on dpns or magic loop&mdash;your choice).  Previous experience making socks (one or two pairs is fine) is necessary for best results.</div>
						<div class=class_meetings>Class meets Tuesdays from 6:30pm to 9:00pm on Jul.&nbsp;8 and 15.</div>

							It always seems that we end up needing "just one more" gift for someone on our Holiday List.  This quick class, using luxury yarns and big needles, will give you the necessary skills to complete something soft and beautiful (and fast!  Rob finished his in one evening watching television) for your favorite someone.  Note: the fuzzy yarn used is NOT mohair, and should be wearable by anyone with mohair or wool allergies. VERY beginner friendly, this class would be a great introduction to knitting in the round on a circular needle.</div>

With this technique, the yarns never tangle and there are no floats to catch those little fingers eager to find the goodies on Christmas morning. You will knit the cuff before class so we can jump right in with the two handed technique. With four skeins of yarn, you will have enough yarn to knit two Christmas Stockings.</div>
