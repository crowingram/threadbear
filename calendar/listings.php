			<div class="class_description">This felted bag is knitted using the entrelac method, a fun technique that resembles a basketweave pattern.  The bag's deep, round shape is great for shopping at open-air summer markets as well as serving very well as a knitting/project bag (deep body with double straps).  Not only will you learn how to knit entrelac, you'll learn how to knit backwards (trust me, it's fun and very useful).  Best of all, it's a great way to try entrelac, as any minor boo-boos will be felted away in the washing machine.</div>

				<em>Fits Like a... Glove</em> is a great pattern by Nancy Lindberg for creating not only gloves but fingerless gloves and "flip-top" gloves! Knit quickly using a small amount of DK weight yarn, these are a relatively easy introduction to glove knitting, and an ideal use for that one special skein of hand-paint that you've been saving. Join Laurie in learning the techniques necessary to create these useful yet pretty hand warmers. By the end of class you should have enough knowledge to complete a pair of gloves on your own. Students should have had experience knitting in the round on double point needles, as these are worked entirely on DPNs. Please keep in mind that these are sized for adults or older children at best; see the pattern for sizing.</div>

This clever patern, constructed more like shoes than like the usual felted slipper, is simple enough for beginners, yet also satisfying for more advanced knitters, as a pair can be done very quickly, creating an ideal last-minute gift. Using less than 350 yards of feltable yarn and large needles, students should be able to complete knitting a pair during class, with the ability to complete their slippers (felting and finishing) on their own.

The bag's deep, round shape is great for shopping at open-air summer markets as well as serving very well as a knitting/project bag (deep body with double straps).  Not only will you learn how to knit entrelac, you'll learn how to knit backwards (trust me, it's fun and very useful).  Best of all, it's a great way to try entrelac, as any minor boo-boos will be felted away in the washing machine.</div>

                we're offering a STASH BASH event that you will NOT want to miss out on.  Starting at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., 
                Marcia, and Helen will work with you (along with myself and Molly, if needed) 
            	to work with your current stash to combine yarns (color, texture, fibers, etc.) that you already own, and 
                possibly bring a little something new into the mix, all with the goal of creating something called the 
                &quot;Omega Wrap&quot;, a design by Chris Bylsma.<br /><br />

				Now for the details.....this fun day of playing with color and texture and knitting will start at 10:30, so bring 
                your stash (seriously--load up a bunch that you like and would want to combine to create your own version) 
                and settle in for a fun day.  We'll help you combine yarns, take basic measurements (to fit around your 
                shoulders, or the shoulders of the intended recipient), and get you started on this great project.  We'll 
                take a break around 12:30ish for lunch (provided by Rob's kitchen.....YUM) and then get back to work on 
                your new wrap, focusing on stitches and blending yarns and more.  It all should finish up around 4&nbsp;p.m., 
                with a good bit of progress on your own version, as well as new knowledge on  how to combine and coordinate 
                things you already own and love into something wonderful to wear and maybe even to gift to special people 
                in your life.  Cost for this day of fun is just $15, which is to reserve your seat and cover the cost of lunch and 
                instruction.  Darned reasonable, and well worth it!  SIGN  UP TODAY to hold your spot, and start rummaging

			<div class="class_description">Got a special skein of sock yarn but you're not sure you'll have enough yardage?  Does knitting on double points make you feel like you're losing a fight with a hedgehog?  Does picking up gusset stitches make your eyes cross? Have you been vanquished by the deadly Second Sock Syndrome?  This class will allow you to deal with these problems and more, by learning how to knit 2 toe-up socks side by side on one long circular!  Techniques will include learning the Magic Loop method, a really nifty cast-on, afterthought heels and working both your socks at the same time, using a basic generic sock pattern that will allow you to use any yarn weight to make socks that are uniquely your own.  Students should have completed at least one sock (or sock class) prior to taking this, and have basic knitting skills.</div>

Why not whip up something for warmer weather that you'll want to wear over and over again in the coming months.  This is a great class for first time sweater knitters, as finishing techniques will also be covered... making this an opportunity to improve those seaming strategies for more experienced knitters, too.</div>

				Knit in the round, in stranded colorwork, this felted bag is a great way to learn to use more 
                than one color on a row.  You'll experience great success with little difficulty, as you'll use only 
                two yarns per row in a masterful method which looks much fancier than it is.  The colorwork 
                presents significant depth by alternating two sets of solid/striping yarns, one set when the 
                pattern &quot;zigs&quot; to the left, and the other set when it &quot;zags&quot; to the right.  When you're done, 
                toss it in the washer and watch a beautiful, sturdy bag emerge&mdash;like magic!</div>
