	<div class=accent2Head>Class &amp; Event Policies:</div>

	<div class=accent2>All class fees pay your instructors, so please help us continue to offer these classes by
		<strong>purchasing class materials at ThreadBear</strong>. If you would prefer to use materials not stocked at
		ThreadBear, please discuss alternatives with Rob or Matt; there are many available options that we do not stock
		every day, and we are glad to make arrangements to bring in the supplies that you need.
	</div>

	<div class=accent2><strong>Registration for classes is not complete until all class fees are paid.</strong> Space
		will be held for three days if participants wish to reserve space over the phone and come into the shop later to
		pay registration fees. We can accept credit card payments for class registration over the phone to pay
		registration fees immediately; receipts for such transactions can be picked up upon next store visit or mailed
		upon request.</div>

	<div class=accent2>To maximixe the time of all participants and your instructors, please <strong>purchase materials
			prior to class</strong> unless otherwise directed for a specific class.</div>

	<div class=accent2>Except in the case of dire circumstances, please respect your peers and instructors by
		<strong>turning off cell phones and pagers during class</strong>. If you believe that mitigating circumstances
		do exist, please discuss them with your instructor prior to the beginning of class and excuse yourself from the
		class area to respond.
	</div>

	<div class=accent2>Class sizes may be limited, so <strong>please sign up as early as you are certain that you can
			attend</strong>. Since cancellations do happen, please consider being an alternate if the class you'd like
		to attend is full.</div>

	<div class=accent2 style="font-weight: bold;">Only cancellations made three days before the beginning of a class
		will receive a full refund of class fees. Refund of any class materials will be based on standard refund policy.
		No partial refund will be issued for sessions not attended. No refund will be issued after classes have begun.
