 		<div class="accent1head">Why doesn't ThreadBear have a shopping cart feature?</div>

 		<div class="accent1">We are a real, bricks-and-mortar yarn shop. Your order comes directly off the shelf in a
 			real, walk-in yarn shop in Lansing, Michigan, goes into a box, and gets shipped directly to you via U. S.
 			Postal Service for only the price of actual postage-- no handling fees, no additional markup.</div>

 		<div class="accent1">So why does that prevent us from using a shopping cart? Well, it doesn't, per se, but
 			since the yarn you want could be in someone else's basket, we want to make sure that what you think you're
 			getting is exactly what gets in your box. We verify dye lots, and we make sure that what you say you want
 			is what we see in our hands.</div>

 		<div class="accent1">We don't have cashiers. We're all knitters, crocheters, spinners, or some combination of
 			the three. If what you say you want isn't what you've pulled up on the screen, our experience will help us
 			recognize that fact and help you find exactly what fits your needs. Is it more convenient? No, probably
 			not. We do think it's better, though. And many of our existing customers have told us they agree. If you
 			don't, we encourage you to <a href="#">let us know</a>.</div>
