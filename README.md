# ThreadBear Fiber Arts Studio

This is a PHP catalog site created in 2002 for a business I founded with a
partner. I continued to maintain the website for several months after leaving
the business in 2009, and this is the last iteration that I was involved with.

Links to resources that no longer exist have been replaced with null links.

The site is currently available for review at http://threadbear.mattwaldrop.com

## Limitations

This site is more than fifteen years old at the time of this writing
and has been offline for more than a decade. It was never completed while
I was involved in operating the business because I was busy operating the
business. If I were building it from scratch today, everything about the way
that it's structured would be different. It is not optimized, responsive, nor
well-documented, but it's posted here for review and storage.
