		<div class="articleContentFirst">
			In conjunction with ThreadBear's Ebenezer Project, Delaine leads a group of folks that are making mittens for local school children, to be distributed this fall when the weather turns cooler.  Last January it was a festival of crock pot cooking combined with a day of mitten making, small break-out groups for specific techniques (mittens from the top down, mittens on one circular needle, etc.), and a variety of door prizes and more.  Well mark your calendars, as there's another day of fun planned!</div>
		
		
		<div class="articleContent">On Sunday, August 23rd, ThreadBear will open our doors a little early at 11am and run a six-hour marathon day of MITTEN MANIA!  We are focusing on the 'bounty of the season' and giving back to others through knitting and crocheting mittens of all sizes, for children of all sizes!  The organizers will supply the lettuce, dressings, plates, and utensils for to create a salad bar--just bring any toppings (tomatoes, veggies, cheeses, crunchies) or other salads that you want to share.  Most of all, we'd like you to join us for a 'feel-good' time that will help keeps kids' hands warm this winter.  I know spending times with other knitters warms my heart - please join us.<br><br>

We have yarn and patterns to share and experts to answer your mitten questions, or feel free to bring things from your own stash--all in the name of making dozens upon dozens of pairs of mittens for local kids.  Of course there will be prizes distributed by winning tickets, along with other fun and nonsense.  Those in attendance can earn tickets by turning in completed mittens as well as playing the 'games' that will happen throughout the afternoon.<br><br>

Mark your calendars NOW for Sunday, August 23rd (just a couple weeks away!) and we'll see you there!</div>
