		<div class="articleContentFirst"><img src="/images/frontpage/091031naturwolle.gif" alt="MaggiKnits Road Show" border="0" align="right" vspace="5" hspace="5">Naturwolle is a very special artisan yarn that has been hand-crafted in the Black Forest region of southwest Germany for over 20 years. Ingeborg, a spinner, found herself looking for something to do when her daughter left for university, so she took a spinning course. She pulled out her spinning wheel, gathered together some beautiful merino fibers, and made the first skeins of this amazing bulky-weight yarn. After spinning enough fiber into yarn and knitting a sweater for herself, friends began to ask if she would spin yarn for them, too. After completing several special orders, a new cottage industry was born!</div>
		
		
		<div class="articleContent">Fast forward twenty years to today, and now Ingeborg has a group of women who meet in her living room to create the beautiful skeins that are available today. One interesting tidbit is that there are no dye lots, only spinner lots (each individual batch can be traced back to the woman who spun the fiber into yarn). It comes in solids, multis, tweeds, tone-on-tone, and more, and works up quickly at a gauge of 3-3.5 stitches per inch. A staple for designers for years, we'll have a HUGE multi-garment trunk show and copious amounts of yarn available in the shop the entire month of December. And here's the fun part!<br><br>

Join us for the kick off on Saturday, December 5th, when our sales rep, Sharon Brock, will be here for the day as the hostess with the mostest! Not only will we have dozens and dozens of models--felted, crocheted, knitted, and more--but we'll have a wide variety of garments (jackets, pullovers, and more), accessories (purses, scarves, hats), baby items (little ugg boots, an adorable leftovers blanket), and more here at the shop for the entire month. Join us on the afternoon of the 4th at 1pm for a celebration of many things German--yarn is just the start of it (and you know there's bound to be munchies, as the Black Forest region is known for amazing ham, delicious tortes, and more). We'll bring together an unprecedented amount of yarn and an unheard of number of garments for this month-long event, but the kick-off day will be something special, as well, with Sharon here to help select the right yarns for the perfect project. MARK YOUR CALENDARS NOW and plan to be here on the first Saturday in December--consider it your St. Nick's day gift to yourself! (one day early). And ask Rob to see the sweater he has started--all for HIMSELF--using two different color combinations of this amazing yarn!</div>
