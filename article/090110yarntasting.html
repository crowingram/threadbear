				<div class="articleHead">Spring 2009 Yarn Tasting Dates Announced</div>
				<div class="articleContentFirst">Maybe you find it hard to believe that warmer weather will return to our area, but we almost always work at least one season ahead of the calendar. That means we're meeting with sales reps, swatching with new yarns, and receiving patterns and yarns for model knitting, all in anticipation of the season and our upcoming YARN TASTING. What's a Yarn Tasting, you might ask? Read on...</div>
				<div class="articleContent">We wrap up our day at the shop and then seal you in (mwahahaha!) for an evening of food, fiber, fun, and fabulous model garments. You're introduced to 15-20 different yarns, varying in weights (from light to thicker choices), fibers (cottons, alpacas, hemp, silks, wools, and more), and types (smooth, singles, textures, and more). You're given 15+ yard sample skeins of EVERY yarn to work with (thus the need for your needle and hook collection), shown a wide variety of model garments (from accessories to cardigans to pullovers and more), and introduced to a few other fun tidbits, all while enjoying light refreshments throughout the evening. Other surprises do pop up during the evening, so you won't want to miss out on this great event. The cost for the evening is $35 and includes special treats, snacks and beverages, your yarn, program, and more.</div>
				<div class="articleContent">Dates for this time around are Saturday, February 28th (starting at 6:30pm) and Sunday, March 1st (starting at 5:30pm). Seats fill up FAST, so be sure to call the shop ASAP to secure yours at 703-YARN (or toll free at 866-939-BEAR). Saturday ALWAYS sells out quickly (sometimes within 48 hours of this announcement) and Sunday fills briskly, so round up your knitting buddies and guarantee your seat with a credit card as soon as you're sure you can attend.</div>
