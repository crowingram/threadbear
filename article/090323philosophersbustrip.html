				<div class="articleHead">Philosopher's Wool Bus Trip</div>
				<div class="articleContentFirst">Join Marcia and company on a fun trip into Canada to visit Philosopher's Wool on Saturday, May 16th, 2009.  It's a day away with friends, yarn, food, two friendly drivers, and a bus with a bathroom. What could be better?!?</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">The bus will leave at 7:30am on May 16th from the parking lot at ThreadBear, and then we're off to Canada. Lunch will be along the way and is included in your fee. We will head up to the farm where you will have an opportunity to visit with Ann and Eugene as well as the sheep. We will see the warehouse and the wool room where most of the sweaters are born and shop at Philosopher's Stone. There you will see a whole bunch of sweaters already knit up so you can try them on and decide which is your favorite. They also have some wonderful gifts and knick knacks in the shop for purchase.</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">Also new and of use to some of you&mdash;our trip will originate from parking lot at ThreadBear and head up I-69 towards the Blue Water Bridge across to Sarnia, but we will be making two quick stops to pick up folks along the way, if necessary. The first stop will be in Flint (at Miller Road and I-69) and the second at Wadhams Road, just west of Port Huron. If you hail from those parts of the state, you don't have to drive all the way into Lansing to partake in the fun! <strong>You will need a passport or birth certificate to cross the border.</strong>Philosopher's can handle American cash, checks or credit cards. We will stop for dinner on the way home at a restaurant in Grand Bend. Marcia recommends a credit card to pay for dinner so you don't have to worry about the exchange rate. We will return home around 10-11pm that same evening. You may wish to bring munchies or drinks for the ride and don't forget your knitting! (Door prizes and other fun things will be along for the ride).</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">The cost of the trip is $70 per person. Please email Marcia with questions, as <em>all registration and planning is handled by her and NOT by ThreadBear</em>. Her e-mail is <a href="mailto:marciacarp@aol.com">marciacarp@aol.com</a>. This is also the perfect time to choose a kit (or kits) to use in our upcoming Philosopher's Wool garment classes.</div>
