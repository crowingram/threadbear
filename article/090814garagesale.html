		<div class="articleContentFirst">It plagues us all, and it’s brought up over and over as a reason not to come hang out with your friends at ThreadBear. It’s foolishness and mayhem of staggering proportions, it’s invaded our lives, it’s diminished our happiness, and we’re just not going to take it anymore.</div>
		
		
		<div class="articleContent"><img src="/images/frontpage/090814stashoutofcontrol.gif" alt="Yarn Tasting" border="0" hspace="5" align="right">What is it? You may call them WIPs you’ll never finish or PIGS you haven’t looked at in forever (those are Works in Progress and Projects in Grocery Sacks for the uninitiated), or they may just be yarns you’ve fallen out of love with for one reason or another or now have insufficient quantity since the discovery of a certain apple crisp on Friday nights… and you’re a little fluffier now. Whichever applies, they’re taking up room in your house and creating stress for you and your cohabitants. It’s even been said by some who shall remain nameless that because of these former delights turned detritus, you can’t buy new yarn that you love now.<br><br>

			HORRORS!!<br><br>

			Well, we’re here to help you turn that unloved yarn, pattern, tote bag, spinning fiber, or whatever ails you into something new and exciting that’s sure to hit your needles/hooks/wheel in record time. How?<br><br>
			
			You bag and tag the stuff you want to see gone, bring it to us August 12-17, and we’ll put it in our Customer Garage Sale August 21-23. Whatever you make at the sale earns store credit for you; if you make $100 at the garage sale, you get $100 store credit. If you want back what doesn’t sell, you can pick it up after the sale. If you just want to see it gone, we can donate it for you. At worst, you clear out some space and donate unwanted items to a good cause. At best, you actually make money toward new projects that you’re actually interested in! What’s more is that this isn’t your average yard sale where no one knows what they’re looking at; your shoppers are actual knitters, crocheters, and spinners, so they understand the value of what you have to offer.<br><br>
