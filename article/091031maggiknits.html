		<div class="articleContent">MaggiKnits is going on the road--it's an International traveling road show with Mary Bell, Director of Operations at MaggiKnits, and Julie Crowther, the UK distributor from Yorkshire, England. This afternoon of fun, learning, and fashion will start with customers being divided into two groups--one group will take an hour class with Mary, learning more about MaggiKnits yarns and working with the amazing Linen and the new Irish Tweed, all while learning Maggie's techniques. The other group will spend time with Julie, learning their own unique color palette (think of it as a sort of &quot;Color Me Beautiful&quot;, but done with various skeins of yarn). After the first hour, the groups will then switch places. The session ends with an informal fashion show of the garments, sharing the history of Maggiknits and Maggie Jackson's Irish heritage and training that influenced her designs. Both Mary and Julie will work with you and teach you about the drape, style, and fitting of Maggiknits garments so you achieve the best results out of your finished project. You can then try on the garments and plan a project using Maggi's yarns and books, all based on Mary's class and Julie's color advice.<br><br>

The cost of this afternoon of learning, fun, fashion, and more is just $50 ($30 covers your class materials, including skeins of MaggiKnits yarns that go home with you) and includes instructional sessions, the fashion show, class materials, color analysis, and all the fun and games of an afternoon with Maggie's able assistants at ThreadBear.</div>
