		<!-- <div class="articleContentFirst">Mark your calendars for Thursday, September 17th through Sunday, September 20th for four days, four shops, and endless possibilities!  ThreadBear Fiber Arts Studio, Yarn Garden in Charlotte, Rae's Yarn Boutique in Lansing, and Woven Art in East Lansing are hosting a shop hop to beat the band.</div> -->
		
		
		<div class="articleContent">Rob, Matt, and the staff are all starting to work in earnest on yarns, patterns, and plans for the upcoming Yarn Tasting event.  What's a Yarn Tasting, you might ask? Read on... We wrap up our day at the shop and then seal you in (mwahahaha!) for an evening of food, fiber, fun, and fabulous model garments. You're introduced to 15-20 different yarns, varying in weights (from light to thicker choices), fibers (alpacas, mohairs, silks, wools, and more), and types (smooth, singles, textures, and more). You're given 15+ yard sample skeins of EVERY yarn to work with (thus the need for your needle and hook collection), shown a wide variety of model garments (from accessories to cardigans to pullovers and more), and introduced to a few other fun tidbits, all while enjoying light refreshments throughout the evening. Other surprises do pop up during the evening, so you won't want to miss out on this great event. The cost for the evening is $35 and includes special treats, snacks and beverages, your yarn, program, and more.<br><br>

Dates for this time around are Saturday, October 10th (starting at 6:30pm) and Sunday, October 11th (starting at 5:30pm) ALWAYS sells out (we're right at full as of this writing) and Sunday fills briskly, so round up your knitting buddies and guarantee your seat with a credit card as soon as you're sure you can attend.</div>
