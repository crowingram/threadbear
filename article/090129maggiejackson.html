Knit a little purse, which is funky and fun by day, and interesting yet elegant by night, depending on your own mood! It can serve as a pouch that holds your &quot;stuff&quot; or as a sachet, filled with lavender or other smell-goods for your bedroom or closet. The perfect accessory for an evening out to the theater or concert, you'll increase across knit as well as purl sts; you'll learn how to create a Picot-hemmed tube, a twisted split, as well as bobbles worked on a split and you'll practice rag and a simple lacy stitch.</div>

Sunday, February 8th, from 11am to 5pm (with a break for lunch)<br>
Cost is $60, which includes a $20 materials fee<br>
Come spend the day with Maggie learning the ins and outs of working in squares! Your final project could be smaller and become a scarf, or keep knitting and turn it into either of two larger sizes for a dramatic wrap! For the truly daring, think about combining your squares to become a show-stopping linen skirt. Maggie will lead you through the process, as well as discussing other options like adding leather bows, fur strips, ridge stitches, ruffles, tubes, knot and tassels, and MUCH, MUCH MORE!!</div>
