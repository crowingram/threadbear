				<strong>EVERY WEEK</strong><br><br>
			
				<strong>Knits 'n Grins</strong><br>
				<em>Every Wednesday &ndash; All day</em><br>
				Not that coming in to knit at ThreadBear is <i>ever</i> discouraged, but this circle formed around a group of friends who decided they wanted a specific time to meet in the shop for a little knitting and camaraderie.  Folks have come and gone since then, but the circle remains to welcome anyone who just wants to get out of the house and share time with other knitters.<br><br>

				<strong>Knit ER</strong><br>
				<em>Every Wednesday &ndash; 6:30pm-8:00pm</em><br>
				Our able staff is always willing to help with knitting problems as time permits, but we do sometimes get busy.  To make sure that you always have a way to get the assistance you need getting out of a fix or understanding pattern instructions, every Wednesday night we have a dedicated &quot;Knit Doctor&quot; who is available just for you.  Instructor Laurie Weir donates her time and expertise to get you through the rough times and on to happy knitting.<br><br>
			
				<strong>FIRST WEEK OF EACH MONTH</strong><br><br>
				
				<strong>Far East Fiber Arts</strong><br>
				<em>First Thursday &ndash; 6:30pm-8:00pm</em><br>
				Matt's had a yen for Japanese patterns for years, and he's eager to share his obsession with you.  Join him for an exploration of patterns, yarns, and all the things you'll need for success in knits and crochet from the Land of the Rising Sun.<br><br>
				
				<strong>Out of Control Spinners</strong><br>
				<em>First Friday &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				Bring your spindle, your wheel, or just your interest, and connect with fellow spinners in a social environment that welcomes newcomers to the craft as well as experienced artisans.  We play with everything from various plying methods to dyeing techniques to blending fibers for unique artisan yarns that every knitter will envy.  And while we officially meet on First Fridays, we've started bringing our wheels every week to the Friday Nights Rock! circle for a little extra wheel time.<br><br>
				
				<strong>Saturday Cinema</strong><br>
				<em>First Saturday &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				Just like it sounds, every month we rent a movie and hang out at the shop for the evening.  Bring your current mindless project and curl up on the sofa with a gaggle of friends.  We pop popcorn and order pizza, and generally get the movie going between 7pm and 7:30pm.  Don't be shy!  We'd love to have you here.<br><br>
			
				<strong>SECOND WEEK OF EACH MONTH</strong><br><br>
				
				<strong>Knitting Mittens</strong><br>
				<em>Second &amp; Third Mondays &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				Enjoy the camaraderie, get a little help, knit along with group projects, and explore patterns, yarns, and techniques for making useful winter warmers with Mitten Maven Janeen and a whole crew of your fellow knitters.<br><br>
				
				<strong>Knitter Fellas: Knitting Circle for Guys</strong><br>
				<em>Second Monday &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				Guys who knit, crochet, or spin frequently feel like... well, the odd man out.  Not so, here!  We've got yarn, we've got fiber, we've got a sense of humor, and we've even got dogs.  What more could a man possibly need?  Bring what you're working on, or come learn a new skill.  Whatever you're about, we're here to offer support and get you where you want to go.<br><br>
				
				<strong>Friday Nights Rock! Memory Keeper Throw Circle</strong><br>
				<em>Second Friday &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				The name's no lie... Friday nights do most certainly rock here at ThreadBear.  Folks start pouring in after work, and by about seven, this place is jumping!  The idea is to start, work on, or swap bits of yarn for a modular sock-yarn blanket, and that certainly happens.  We have primers for the newbies, and veteran blanketeers have even put together kits of bits from their own stashes to get you started.  That's just the beginning, though.  If you're game, you're also welcome to participate in a potluck dinner that participants organize in <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/groups/threadbear-tales" target="_blank">our group on Ravelry</a>; what's more, this gang has had so much fun, they've started meeting on every other Friday night of the month&mdash;meaning <em>every</em> other... first, third, fourth, and even fifth if one happens that month&mdash;and just bring snacks... and their knitting, of course.  It's gotten so crazy, even us Out of Control Spinners have started coming in on those off weeks to join in the fun.  Don't be surprised if you pull into the parking lot and are met with huge numbers of cars.  Seriously, Friday Nights ROCK!<br><br>
				
				<strong>Surprise Along</strong><br>
				<em>Second Saturday &ndash; 10:30am to 12:00pm</em><br>
				Schoolhouse Press has recently released Elizabeth's Zimmerman's original Baby Surprise Jacket with options for child and adult sizing, and we just couldn't pass up the opportunity to play with this intriguing pattern that's now forty years old.  Matt made one in his own handspun yarn for a new great niece who's on the way, and Rob's done a couple of baby versions and is working on a child's size, now.  They're fun, easy, and always worth a conversation as folks try to figure out what on earth you're knitting!  It starts out looking almost like you're just knitting a big rectangle... then things get weird... really weird.  It's knitting origami that will have you turning your knitting upside-down and sideways, but you'll love every minute of it.<br><br>
				
				<strong>Ebenezer Project:  Keeping the Spirit of Giving Alive Throughout the Year</strong><br>
				<em>Second Sundays &ndash; 1:00pm-3:00pm</em><br>
				Many of us learned to knit or crochet very specifically to make something for someone we love.  We honor that gift-giving spirit by providing handmade gifts for those who most dearly need to know that someone else is thinking of them.  We donate as much as possible right here in the Lansing area and frequently have multiple projects going on at any given time.  We're also very proud to invite you to our second <a href="/article/display_article.php?article=090813mittenmania">Mitten Mania event</a>.<br><br>
			
				<strong>THIRD WEEK OF EACH MONTH</strong><br><br>
				
				<strong>Fiberklatsch: Stitcher's Night Out</strong><br>
				<em>Third Saturday &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				Originally organized as our open knitting night, Fiberklatsch remains a fun evening out for all comers.  What it has grown into, though, is an opportunity to get out of the house and join a bunch of friends for Chinese delivery and a fun evening of laughter and mayhem.  We break out the take-out menus as soon as we have quorum, and from there, it's anyone's game.  Do come join us.  You'll be glad you did.<br><br>
				
				<strong>Girasole Knit Along</strong><br>
				<em>Third Sunday &ndash; 12:00pm to 1:45pm</em><br>
				Jared Flood of Brooklyn Tweed fame and author of the new pattern collection <i>Made in Brooklyn</i> from Classic Elite has done it again with this beautiful vintage lace pattern turned throw.  Marcia's got participants at every stage of execution, so don't be shy about jumping in.  There are folks in Chart A, some in B, C, D, E, and in edging, and Marcia's working on a lace-weight version, while Rob's doing a heavier-weight throw.  There are all sorts of options, so come see what's going on.<br><br>
			
				<strong>FOURTH WEEK OF EACH MONTH</strong><br><br>
				
				<strong>Sock It To Me: Sock Knitting Circle</strong><br>
				<em>Fourth Monday &ndash; 6:30pm-9:00pm</em><br>
				Socks are a perennial favorite amongst knitters as a whole, and we're no exceptions.  After a hiatus over the summer months, Matt's back and ready to go with new tutorials, fun new projects, and more fun sock yarn than you can shake two... or five sticks at.  This month's tutorial is on getting the most out of short yardage by a little creative surgery!<br><br>
				
				<strong>Manos del Uruguay Block of the Month Group</strong><br>
				<em>Fourth Saturday &ndash; 11:00am-12:30pm</em><br>
				If you've not paid much attention to these beautiful throws, you should really come in and see the one that we have on display.  It's a fantastic use of this extraordinary kettle-dyed Uruguayan wool, and the stitch patterns are both approachable and beautiful.  Even Matt's mom tried out one of these beauties as one of her very first projects with great success, and her only assistance was via emergency calls to Michigan from her home in Georgia.  Planned out through the group, one block per month will get you a completed throw in only a year, but once you get started, you may be tempted to jump ahead... and who are we to stop you?  That's why Rob presents two blocks each month and allows you do decide if you want to work just one or both.<br><br>
