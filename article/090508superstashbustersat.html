			We think you should get to play with your stash! So, on Saturday, May 16, we'll be offering four short workshops over the course of the day to share ways of using your stash as the well-stocked pantry of great chef's kitchen... that's you... the great chef. Get it? Chef = Knitter? Ah, well. Here's what we're doing.

				11am | <strong>Horst Schultz Modular Blocks</strong> with Rob. Rob's going to share his take on a few of the Module Master's own multi-fiber "blocks."<BR><BR>
				
				1pm | <strong>Stranding 101: Parallel Processing</strong> with Matt. Yes, our favorite geek will share a few secrets for holding multiple strands of yarn together for a custom fabric all your own. This technique is also a great way to make yardage go further with larger quantities of a single stash yarn. Isn't there something in your stash that you got some of but don't think you have enough of to make what you want?<BR><BR>
				
				3pm | <strong>Stranding 102: Serial Processing</strong> with Matt. If you're after a less bulky but still rich, multi-layered fabric, Matt has great pointers for using individual lengths of multiple yarns to create depth and achieve color and texture blends that are next to impossible to achieve using a single yarn.<BR><BR>
				
				5pm | <strong>Sally's Stash-Busting Styles</strong> with Rob. Years after its publication, Sally Melville's <em>Styles</em> continues to offer some spectacular ideas for incorporating stash bits into your projects with spectacular results. She even offers an easy way of using up scrap bits that don't remotely match in a garment that you'll wear and want to wear for years to come.<BR><BR>
				
				There's no charge for any of these classes, but if you would, please drop us an e-mail RSVP at staff@threadbearfiberarts.com so that we can make sure we have sufficient seating for each workshop. Or, of course, feel free to call locally at 703-YARN or toll-free nationally at 866-939-BEAR. Just tell them you want to get your name on the list. You're under no obligation to show, but if you aren't going to make it, please, let us know.<BR><BR>
