				<div class="articleHead">Block Party Weekend</div>
				<div class="articleContentFirst">We're turning into block heads in these parts, as Blankie Mania sweeps over mid-Michigan (and around the globe, to tell the truth).  From the Memory Keeper Throw group that's been gathering every Friday evening around 5 or 6pm to all sorts of modular/domino knitting and crocheting projects popping up in your tote bags and beyond, it appears to be all the rage right now, and who can argue?  These little squares are fun to make, take only a little bit of yarn, and can be whipped up in a matter of a few minutes using basic skills.  The social side of the craft is another big plus&mdash;our Friday nights have seen 15-20 (or more) folks showing up to carry on, swap yarn, knit, and snack on a wide range of things (we had a PACKED table of beverages and snacks last week&mdash;THANK YOU to everyone who's been bringing treats to share), all in the name of the lowly square.  Who are we to argue?  So, why not support it with...</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><b>BLOCK PARTY WEEKEND!</b><br>
Come join us on the third weekend in April (the 17th through 19th) for a wide range of activities, FREE mini-classes, swaps, food, friends, fun, and more.  Keep reading...</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><b>Friday, April 17th</b><br>
6pm | <strong>Memory Keeper Throw Support Group, Yarn Swap, and Social</strong> &ndash; typically on the SECOND Friday of the month, we postponed things a week to avoid Good Friday on the 10th (and honestly, they've been meeting WEEKLY of late).  Take some time out of your busy schedule to socialize, imbibe in light libations (there's always knitting juice, and sometimes fizzy stuff), enjoy some snacks (all sorts show up!), knit some blocks, swap some yarn, and enjoy the company of other square-crazed knitters.</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><b>Saturday, April 18th</b><br>
10am | <strong>It's a Yarn Swap!</strong> (until noon) &ndash; Bring your own stash of sock/fingering-weight yarns and trade with others.  You never know what someone else has that you might want, so come ready to wind off a little of your own and to get something wonderful out of someone else's bag of goodies.  The more the merrier, as that means GREATER choice and diversity!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">11am | <strong>Blankie Primer</strong> &ndash; Interested in getting started with squares but don't know where to begin?  Matt will guide you through the details of the basic square, joining two squares together, and the half-square (side filler) that are all necessary to create your own version of this highly-addictive project.  Just bring odds and ends of sock/fingering-weight yarn, your US 2 needles (dpns, circs, straights), and a sense of humor&mdash;they're fun to make and you'll definitely learn bunches!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">1pm | <strong>Spiffin' up the Blankie</strong> &ndash; tarting it up a little bit, Rob will show you how to work with multiple colors, go beyond the basics of all garter stitch, discuss edging options, and delve into knitting strips and joining them together.  There's a tiny bit of HOMEWORK BEFORE CLASS (with worsted-weight yarn, cast on and knit a strip that's 9sts wide and 6in long; bring a circular needle, too).  This technique is useful for all sorts of projects, not just the blankie!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">3pm | <strong>Design Techniques</strong> with Matt, where you'll cover &quot;Planning the Blankie&quot; (in terms of color, texture, and more), but then move on to using these modular techniques for designing your own project&mdash;even so far as to create a sweater or other garment.  Learn the basics of creating a &quot;muslin&quot; and based on time, how computer software can play into the mix, too</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">4pm | <strong>It's a Yarn Swap!</strong> (until 6pm) &ndash; Bring your own stash of sock/fingering-weight yarns and trade with others.  You never know what someone else has that you might want, so come ready to wind off a little of your own and to get something wonderful out of someone else's bag of goodies.  The more the merrier, as that means GREATER choice and diversity!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">5pm | <strong>Log Cabin Techniques</strong> &ndash; think that it's all about the mitered square?  Oh no!  Marcia takes you one step further and shows how to use Log Cabin techniques to create modular projects, from blankets to sweaters to felted bags and more.  The perfect gateway from quilting to knitting, you're sure to pick up some great tips and tricks in this session</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">6pm | <strong>Fiber Klatsch</strong> &ndash; ThreadBear's once-a-month open knitting/crocheting/whatever night where we gather to work on project(s) in progress, order up some Chinese take out (Dutch Treat), and enjoy and evening out of the house with like-minded folks</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><b>Sunday, April 19th</b><br>
10:30am | <strong>Ravelry Meet Up and Continental Breakfast</strong> &ndash; We'll be throwing a little party for the Ravelry folk among us, before the shop officially opens.  Not only will we put out a spread of nosh and nibbles for you to enjoy, there will be other surprises and treats, too, all for members of Ravelry.  To get in early, just send a Rav-message to Rob (aka blackdog), and your username goes on &quot;the list&quot; that gets you in the door before we open at 12 noon to the general public.  Not a member yet or don't have a clue what Ravelry is? <a href=”http://www.ravelry.com/invitations”><b>Start here</b></a> to sign up for an account to this FREE online fiber arts community that's a great resource for knitters, crocheters, and spinners alike (it's about a four-day wait, currently, so hop to it!).</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">1pm | <strong>Beyond the Blankie</strong> &ndash; What else can we do with modular/domino knitting besides the Memory Keeper Throw?  I'm glad you asked!  Rob will share a wide range of other patterns and projects using these techniques, from garments to accessories to home dec items and more.  You won't believe your eyes, and you'll want to start some NOW&mdash;trust us!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">2 pm | <strong>It's a Yarn Swap!</strong> (until 4pm) &ndash; Bring your own stash of sock/fingering-weight yarns and trade with others.  You never know what someone else has that you might want, so come ready to wind off a little of your own and to get something wonderful out of someone else's bag of goodies.  The more the merrier, as that means GREATER choice and diversity!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent">3pm | <strong>Module Mania</strong> &ndash; Matt leads you through the basics of working modules in other shapes such as long cabin, shells, diamonds, bricks, and more.  Yes, it's hip to be square, but modular knitting can take on a WIDE range of shapes&mdash;come see the diversity that's found in this wonderful technique!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><em>Workshop Materials:</em>  We'll focus on teaching technique with worsted-weight odds and ends from your stash (bring a few shades), along with US 7 or 8 needles (adjust up or down for your own personal tension issues).   Any additional homework/prep will be posted on a whiteboard by the class table 15 minutes before start time, and will be VERY VERY basic, if any at all.  The only &quot;serious&quot; prep you need to do is for Rob's 1pm Saturday class, and that's just a 6&quot; strip of knitting that's 9 sts wide.  Blankie Primer with Matt (11am on Saturday) uses sock/fingering-weight yarn and US 2s.</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><i><b>Every single one of the above-mentioned events is FREE OF CHARGE and guaranteed to be fun!</b></i>  We're excited to share our love of knitting and crocheting using these fun techniques and hope you'll catch the bug and share in our insanity, too!  Not only is this a great way to use up leftovers from other projects, modular/domino knitting can be a fantastic way to incorporate extra skeins, bargain finds, and a wide range of weights of yarns into one cohesive, attractive garment.  Yes, I said it&mdash;you can use STASH and BARGAINS to make something beautiful that you'll be proud to say &quot;why YES, I did make this myself&quot;.  And we're glad to help!</div>
				
				<div class="articleContent"><em>A quick side note:</em> those of you driving in from various points across the area may want to consider car pooling for additional savings. Here is the link to the <a href="http://mdotwas1.mdot.state.mi.us/public/carpoolpark/"><strong>PARK AND RIDES PAGE</strong></a> with the Department of Transportation.  Also, we've once again worked with one of our favorite local hotels for a special room rate for the weekend&mdash;just reference &quot;ThreadBear&quot; when you call to make reservations at the Country Inn &amp; Suites, a quick five-minute ride from the shop and just off I-496 (call the property directly at 517-827-7000 instead of the generic reservation line for the entire chain). The bargain pricing goes a little bit like this: $20 off the rack rate on rooms, or $84 for standard rooms, $94 for studio rooms, and $104 for the suites.  Their website is <a href="http://www.countryinns.com/lansingmi_west"><strong>HERE</strong></a>, and we always use this property to host our out-of-town teachers, with HIGH praise for cleanliness, quiet, and comfort.</div>
