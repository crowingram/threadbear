				<strong>Aran Sweater Design</strong><BR>
				<em>Saturday, June 27th, from 10am to 5pm (hour break for lunch)</em><BR>
				Aran sweaters have a tremendous appeal for knitters who like working textural stitches. However, their complexity scares many knitters away from designing and drafting their own Arans; problems such as picking compatible stitch patterns, working with multiple stitch gauges, and accommodating shaping can seem insurmountable. Once the basic concepts have been mastered, though, Aran sweater design can be fun and challenging. Students will leave the class being able to design and draft a basic Aran sweater. $65 plus materials<BR>
				<em>Special Supplies Needed:</em> 4 oz of worsted-weight yarn, size US 7, 8, or 9 circular needles.<BR><BR>

				An excerpt from her web page really describes this humble woman: &quot;I would describe myself as more determined than talented&mdash;it took several years to build up confidence as a designer&mdash;but it seems that the most successful people are the ones who are the most determined. And for me, success is a lot more than money or fame. Success is a job I love&mdash;one which allows me to be home with my two kids, manage my husband's construction business, putter in my garden, enjoy the beauty of Montana, and (of course) knit a lot. Every day is an adventure. Who could ask for more? Happy knitting. It's the only kind you should have.&quot;<BR><BR>
