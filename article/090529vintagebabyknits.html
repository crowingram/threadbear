			<I>Vintage Baby Knits</I> Author, Kristen Rengren, will join us at ThreadBear for an author Meet &amp; Greet to kick off a trunk show of projects from the book.  Early reviews are spectacular.  If you've got babies to knit for or just enjoy the art of baby knits for their own sake, this is a show not to be missed.
