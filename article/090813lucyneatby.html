Ernest, some of you may know, is the chicken-purse companion of none other than knitting great, <strong>LUCY NEATBY</strong>.  Yes, her purse is a chicken, so yeah, she fits in here.

			For those of you who <i>don't</i> know, Lucy Neatby is just about the most wonderful knitting instructor working in North America.  She's brilliant for one thing.  She's courageous for another.  She seems always to be out on a limb with her knitting and thus manages to find the most intriguing, most interesting, most fun, and most useful techniques that I, for one, have ever seen.  If you also consider that she's a very approachable instructor, offering some of the most clear and understandable instructions and demonstrations, you begin to see why her classes are always packed to overflowing.  When you then realize that she's also incredibly nice and irresistibly funny, you know why we love her.<br><br>
			
			Lucy's bringing her dog and pony show (complete with chicken) to Lansing the weekend of October 2-4, 2009.  Do the dates look familiar?  They should.  That's the weekend of the Michigan-Michigan State game in East Lansing.  Why is that important?  Well, for those of you interested in staying in Lansing overnight (those that don't live here, anyway), it means that you will want to make your plans quickly as rooms will become scarce as hen's teeth (sorry, Ernest) before too much longer.  To help out, ThreadBear has arranged for a discounted rate at the Country Inn &amp; Suites (very clean, very quiet, and very near the shop), and as of today's writing, there are rooms available... but not many!  Here are their deets.<br><br>

			As for her regal Lucyness, she's got some awesome classes lined up for us this go-round.<br><br>
			
			On Friday, October 2nd, she's offering a full day of double knitting...<br><br>
			
			<strong><img src="/images/article/090815doubleupandaround.jpg" alt="Double Up and Around" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Double Up and Around</strong><br>
			<em>Friday, October 2 - 10am to 1pm</em><br>
			Make an exploratory journey into the mysterious (but definitely doable) realm of Double Knitting, a traditional technique for producing two layers of back-to-back knit fabric.  You'll begin with tubes within tubes worked in the round... first with a single yarn, then with two, and eventually on to color patterning.  You'll look at different ways to handle the yarns for maximum efficiency, how to incorporate shaping into double fabrics, and how to work a tubular bind-off.  Used in mittens, socks, hats, or garments, double knit fabrics offer beauty, warmth, and luxurious coziness to all manner of projects.<br><br>
			
			<strong>Double Knitting for the Addicted</strong><br>
			<em>Friday, October 2 - 2pm to 5pm</em><br>
			Take your double knitting to new levels of delight.  You'll learn to make side-opening pockets with vertical or diagonal edges as well as other subtle containment spaces.  You'll also learn to plan, chart, work different designs on both sides of the fabric, and work horizontal and vertical patterning with slip stitches.  You'll even learn to turn a heel into a double-knit sole fabric.  And you'll even have time after class to shop for a while, grab dinner, and/or explore your new-found techniques with your classmates since the shop will be open well into the evening for our Friday Nights Rock! group.<br><br>
			
			Then on Saturday morning...<br><br>

			<em>Saturday, October 3 - 10am to 1pm</em><br>
			How often does a beautiful skein of hand painted yarn knit up to be a disappointment? Discover new ways of knitting with your hand painted yarns. Look at the styles of variegated yarns and for which purposes they are most suited. Try stranded patterns, slipped stitches, intarsia, bobbles and assembled knitting.  You'll also tackle garment/project planning plus how to avoid blotching and mismatching of sections as time permits.<br><br>
			
			And in the afternoon...<br><br>

			<strong><img src="/images/article/090815contentedstitch.jpg" alt="The Contented Stitch" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">The Contented Stitch</strong><br>
			<em>Saturday, October 3 - 2pm to 5pm</em><br>
			This class is designed for both newer and seasoned knitters who would like to learn to read and understand their knitted fabric. With these skills, row counters, and paper records become aids rather than lifelines! We will look at...<br><br>
			
			&middot; the structure of a knit fabric both in stockinette stitch and garter and what makes for a contented stitch,<br>
			&middot; the long-tail / continental cast-on method and how to make it do your bidding,<br>
			&middot; decreases and how to recognize them,<br>
			&middot; increases and their differences,<br>
			&middot; dropping stitches and staging rescues, and<br>
			&middot; how to mark your position and count rows.<br><br>
			
			If you want to better understand what your fabric, its underlying construction, and how to keep it both on track and beautiful, this class is absolutely not to be missed.<br><br>
			
			Then on Sunday...<br><br>
			
			<hr style="color: #FFFFFF; clear: both; height: 0px; width: 0px;">
			
			<strong><img src="/images/article/090815shortrows.jpg" alt="Short Row Wizardry!" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5">Short Row Wizardry!</strong><br>
			<em>Sunday, October 4 - 10am to 5pm with an hour break for lunch</em><br>
			Take a practical look at short rows and their many applications to better tailor your knitting.  Try unwrapped, wrapped, yarn-over and Japanese short rows and compare their merits.  You'll learn to make short rows in garter stitch and mitered corners.  You'll also learn how to improve fit and finish by planning your own shaping for those bulgy bits we all have including conversion of doorstep shoulder directions to short rows.  After lunch (yeah, that was just the morning!), with the mechanics of short rows under your belt, you'll get into the <i>REALLY</i> fun stuff!  You'll explore garter stitch short rows to create the ultimate practical, comfortable, generic sock heel.  You'll try ruffled edges, shaping for collars and sleeves, and turning a lace corner.  You'll learn to knit a circular disc by working only straight rows, and you'll play with free-style short rows... both flat and three-dimensional.<br><br>
			
			The half-day classes on Friday and Saturday are $50 per session, and Sunday's full day of short rows is $100.  Sign up for all five sessions across three days and we'll take off 10% ($270 versus $300, individually).
